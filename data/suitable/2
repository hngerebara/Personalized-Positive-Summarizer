    England's Katarina Johnson-Thompson will miss the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow because of a foot injury.


    The 21-year-old was told to withdraw on medical advice after being diagnosed with a "stress reaction".


    She said: "The Commonwealths was a key target for me this year. I was feeling so good in my preparation up until this week so this is a real blow."


    Johnson-Thompson posted the highest heptathlon score of the year with a 
    
personal-best 6,682 points 

     last month.


    Her performance at the prestigious Hypo-Meeting in Gotzis made her one of the favourites to win gold in Glasgow.


    The Liverpudlian said: "All the advice is telling me that I risk long-term damage if I compete in a heptathlon in just over a week's time, and I have to take that advice for the sake of my career."


    Johnson-Thompson had been competing in the long jump, one of the seven heptathlon disciplines, in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games, which open on Wednesday.


    She 
    
won silver at the World Indoor Championships 

     in March and set a personal best of 6.92m 
    
at the Glasgow Diamond League 

     meeting earlier this month.


    "I really hope to be able to compete in the long jump at the European Championships next month, but it doesn't take away how gutted I am that I won't be at the Commonwealths," Johnson-Thompson said.


    With Olympic champion 
    
Jessica Ennis-Hill absent after giving birth 

     and Morgan Lake, 17, focusing on the World Junior Championships, Grace Clements and Jessica Taylor will 
    
represent England.Ã‚
