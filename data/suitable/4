A paddy field in northern Japan has been transformed into a giant artwork featuring Mount Fuji. 

Artists in the village of Inakadate used different coloured rice plants in the field measuring 100m by 140m to create the stunning image.

The scene is from a legend about Mount Fuji and a heavenly maiden and commemorate the peak's registration as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site last year.
