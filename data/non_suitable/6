Three Dutch investigators have examined bodies from the crashed Malaysia Airlines passenger plane, which are being kept on a train in east Ukraine. 

The experts said the train may later leave the rebel-held town of Torez to start identification process.

All 298 people on board MH17 died - the Ukrainian government says 272 bodies have been recovered.
