A badly injured motorcyclist has been mugged by a thief who pretended to give him first aid, when he was in fact stealing cash.

The fake "good Samaritan" was caught on a cyclist's head camera when he came over to the site of a crash between a blue Triumph Bonneville motorcycle and silver Audi outside a supermarket in Hayes, west London last month.

The 51-year-old motorcyclist had serious leg injuries and was lying in the road bleeding heavily when the conman appeared to come to help.

He is suspected of stealing Â£40 cash from the stricken rider after the accident outside Lidl in Uxbridge Road, Hayes on June 7.
Pc Raj Patara said: "We appeal to anyone who may know the identity of this man who robbed a badly injured victim while he was in a state of shock and bleeding heavily. Do you recognise him?

"We know that a small crowd gathered at the scene and further witness mobile phone recordings may have been taken. We are keen to trace any new pieces of evidence. Where you there? Did you take a recording?"

The suspect is a light-skinned, slim black man, who is in his 30s. He was wearing a baseball cap backwards, tan coloured shorts and an orange patterned shirt, and had a strong West Indian accent.
