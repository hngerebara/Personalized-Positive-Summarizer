A Ukrainian train carrying bodies from the Malaysia Airlines plane crash has left the station of the town of Torez.

Officials say the train will go to Kharkiv, but there is no confirmation.

Pro-Russian separatists, who are in control of the crash site, had placed the remains of the passengers of flight MH17 in refrigerated carriages.

Western countries say the plane was shot down by the rebels. There has been heavy fighting in the main rebel-held city of Donetsk on Monday.Media playback is unsupported on your device
