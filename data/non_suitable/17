A sea eagle chick, featured on BBC Springwatch, which was seen being pushed out of the nest by an intruder eagle has successfully flown the nest.

The young chick, which fell 30ft, was seen via webcam being shoved out of the Mull nest by another bird - behaviour never recorded in Scotland before.

It was returned to the nest by Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) rangers.

Worried viewers noticed the nest empty again but it was confirmed that the chick fledged successfully on Thursday.

The three-month old was seen perched in nearby woodland and was flying strongly.

Dave Sexton, the RSPB's Mull officer, who has been monitoring the nest, said: "We were initially concerned as there was no sign of the chick and I couldn't hear her either which was unusual.

"But I'm delighted and relieved to say that she'd already flown some distance from the nest and I eventually found her sitting on top of a tree stump surveying the view around her.

"Her father was watching from nearby. From her new vantage point she could see Ben More to the south, Coll and Tiree to the west and Rum  to the north.

"We wish her well as she starts her new life exploring the length and breadth of Scotland."

He added: "The webcam has allowed viewers from around the globe to share the secret world of sea eagles and to have a window on to Mull. 

"It's been a fantastic success and now with a very happy ending, or should I say beginning?"

The Mull Eagle Watch project is a partnership between FCS, RSPB, Scottish Natural Heritage, Police Scotland and the Mull & Iona Community Trust.
