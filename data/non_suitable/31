Two men have been charged by detectives investigating a smash and grab raid by a moped gang on the Dorchester Hotel.

Unemployed brothers Reed Roberts, 23, and Skye Roberts, 19, are due to appear at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court in London today in connection with Thursday's robbery at the five-star hotel, Scotland Yard said.

The plush Mayfair venue was hit for the second time in a month by a moped-riding gang who smashed their way into the building in the early hours of the morning and broke into display cabinets.

The luxury hotel was hit in exactly the same way on June 10, when watches and jewellery were stolen in what police called a "well-planned" heist.

Reed and Skye Roberts, of Cubitt Street in King's Cross, north London, are both charged with robbery and possession with intent to supply a Class B drug.
The hotel is currently at the centre of a storm of controversy over its owner, the Sultan of Brunei, who is introducing sharia law to the country, which stipulates gay people should be stoned to death.
