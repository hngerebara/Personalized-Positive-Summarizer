A man has been charged with threatening and disorderly conduct after an incident involvingâ€¦ a watermelon.

Carmine Cervellino, of Connecticut, was arrested after his wife complained to police that he had left a watermelon on their kitchen countertop with a large butcher knife sticking out of it.

Cervellino then walked into the room and began stabbing the fruit in what police described as a â€œpassive aggressiveâ€ manner, the Register Citizen reports.

The 49-year-old was accused of resorting to the tactics to â€œintimidate her because he is angry with her,â€ it said in the police report.

The New York Post reports that the wife, whom it names as Carol, had earlier told police she had found marijuana and drugs in his toolbox. 

A police investigation found no evidence and Cervellino faces no drugs charges.

He is on bail after posting a $500 bond.
