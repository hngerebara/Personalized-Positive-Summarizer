This toy ain't for tots.
Misty Ann Lee, 38, was buzzted after allegedly trying to steal a vibrator from a Spencer's gift shop in Spartanburg, South Carolina by hiding the sex toy behind her child in a stroller, according to GoUpstate.com.

Lee went into Sepncer's Friday afternoon, stroller in tow, and picked up "a vibrator from the love unit," according to a police report obtained by The Smoking Gun. The store manager told police that she watched Lee "slide the vibrator behind a young child in the stroller."

When the manager confronted Lee, Lee allegedly claimed she had no idea what she was talking about, but found herself on shaky ground after the manager pulled the vibrator out of the stroller. Lee left, but returned to the store later, which is when the manager called the cops.
